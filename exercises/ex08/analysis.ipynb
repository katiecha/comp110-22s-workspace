    "## Brainstorming Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflect on your personal experiences and observations in COMP110 and **brainstorm modifications to the course that _create value_ beyond its current design**. When brainstorming, try not to be critical of the ideas you come up with regarding scale, stakeholders impacted, or for any other reasons. In the markdown cell below, brainstorm 3 to 5 ideas you think would create value for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each brainstormed idea should state a. the suggested change or addition, b. what the expected value created, and c. which specific stakeholders would benefit.  If helpful, expand on the following template \"The course should (state idea here) because it will (state value created here) for (insert stakeholders here).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Example A: \"The course should use only examples from psychology experiments because it will be more relevant for students who are psychology majors.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Example B: \"The course should not have post-lesson questions because they are not useful for most students in the class.\""

    "3. The course should continue to offer an async portion of the class because it will offer schedule flexibility to busy students who have not taken in-person classes for almost 2 years.\n",
    "4. The course should provide note outlines for topics covered in lecture because it will highlight the important parts of lecture for students prior to class.\n",
    "5. The course should offer extra examples to reinforce topics because it will offer another way to certify how a concept works for students struggling with the materials from lesson videos."

One aspect of _continuous improvement_ is trying to avoid \"tunnel vision\" where possible improvements are not considered because there is no data available to analyze it.

    "\n",
    "2. Suggestion for how to collect data to support this idea in the future: In the next semester of COMP110, extra credit should be offered for attending office hours. Throughout this semester, office hour visits should be tracked. The number of office hour visits from the Spring 2022 semester should be compared to the number of visits from the following Fall 2022 semester to see if the incentive of extra credit increases the total number of office hour visits. The understanding level of students in the Fall 2022 semester can be graphed with the number of office hours they attended to see if the increased visits to office hours increases understanding."
